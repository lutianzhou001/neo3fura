### What kind of data can you get from Neofura

Anything about Neo! You can not only use Neo RPC ([https://docs.neo.org/docs/zh-cn/reference/rpc/latest-version/api.html](https://docs.neo.org/docs/zh-cn/reference/rpc/latest-version/api.html)) directly in Neofura but also use many re-designed APIs. For example, how many assets in your address? What's the balance of your assets? How many transactions have occurred in the last hour? Who are the committees and candidates? You can get the answer from Neofura now. Further more, you can email us to submit your own data needs of Neo.
